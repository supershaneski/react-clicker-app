react-clicker-app
========

A basic clicker game/incremental idle game made using React.
It saves the game state in localStorage.

This React project is bootstrapped using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

# State Management

I am using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) to handle global state management.

```sh
$ npm install zustand
```

> This is a work in progress...

# Getting Started

Clone the repository, install the dependencies and run

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/supershaneski/react-clicker-app.git myproject

$ cd myproject

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173/` or some other port depending on the availability.
